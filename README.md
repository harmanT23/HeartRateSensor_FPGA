This is an open source project that was developed for a course we were taking at the University of Toronto. It is a heart rate monitoring system written in C/NIOS II to be used on a DE1-SoC FPGA along side a pulse sensor (i.e. https://pulsesensor.com/) that is interfaced with the FPGA. 

Feel free to build off of this project but do not plagiarize this code for any school related projects.
